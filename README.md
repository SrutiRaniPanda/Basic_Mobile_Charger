**THEORY**
The charging circuit we are designing contains 3 main 
circuit components, i.e., step-down transformer, full 
bridge rectifier and voltage regulator(IC7805).
First, we make use of a transformer to step down the voltage from 
220V to 12V. 
Since we are making use of IC7805, we 
provide a 12V input to the rectifier circuit.
After filtering this AC signal, we will get a DC output of 12V from the 
rectifier circuit, and then we feed this input to the 
voltage regulator circuit(IC7805).
After feeding the input to the regulator circuit, we obtain a DC output of 5V, 
then by using a USB connector we give this input to the 
charging cable which is connected to the mobile. 
When we switch on the circuit we can see the phone is 
charging.

**PROCEDURE**
Create a circuit as shown below on a breadboard.
Attach the terminals of the transformer to the full 
wave rectifier which is then connected to the IC7808 
transistor along with a few capacitors on the way in 
parallel, and connect a load resistor complete the 
circuit.

**CONCLUSION**
Through this experiment, I learned the behavior of
reference voltage generation circuit.
This experiment also taught me how to assemble, 
observe, and analyze the reference voltage generation 
circuit.
